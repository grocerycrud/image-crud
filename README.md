Image CRUD is an automatic multiple image uploader for Codeigniter, using the same philosophy as grocery CRUD library. 
Just some simple lines of code and you have all the functionality that you need.

Requirements:

- Codeigniter version 4
- PHP version 8 or higher
- PHP GD2 extension
- Composer

Limitations:

Since this is basically the same library as we used for Codeigniter 3, it has the same limitations.
- Image CRUD only works when the url that loads it is a standard Controller / View path. For example: 
  `/controller/method` . Anything else won't work. For example: `/admin/controller/method`. This will most probably
   change in the future
